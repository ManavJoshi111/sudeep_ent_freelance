            The purpose behind this section is to be able to provide the patient or a family member enough information
            and
            resources to understand their situation or condition better. Every possible condition of the ear, nose and
            throat has been detailed out with instructions on both pre/post operative procedures. There is also
            important
            information on lifestyle modifications and other consequences and precautions that one may have to be aware
            about. Still, this section is only an information tool and is not a replacement for a consultation with your
            specialist.

                        The ear consists of the outer, middle and inner ear. Sound travels through the outer ear and
                        reaches the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibration is then transmitted through three tiny
                        bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. The vibration then enters the inner ear where the nerve
                        cells are. The nerve cells within the inner ear are stimulated to produce nerve signals. These
                        nerve signals are carried to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.

                        The ear consists of the outer, middle and inner ear. Sound travels through the outer ear and
                        reaches the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibration is then transmitted through three tiny
                        bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. The vibration then enters the inner ear where the nerve
                        cells are. The nerve cells within the inner ear are stimulated to produce nerve signals. These
                        nerve signals are carried to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.
