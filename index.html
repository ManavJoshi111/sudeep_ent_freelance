        The purpose behind this section is to be able to provide the patient or a family member enough information and
        resources to understand their situation or condition better. Every possible condition of the ear, nose and
        throat has been detailed out with instructions on both pre/post operative procedures. There is also important
        information on lifestyle modifications and other consequences and precautions that one may have to be aware
        about. Still, this section is only an information tool and is not a replacement for a consultation with your
        specialist.

                        The ear consists of the outer, middle and inner ear. Sound travels through the outer ear and
                        reaches the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibration is then transmitted through three tiny
                        bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. The vibration then enters the inner ear where the nerve
                        cells are. The nerve cells within the inner ear are stimulated to produce nerve signals. These
                        nerve signals are carried to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.
